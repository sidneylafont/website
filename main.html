			<p class="about alignLeft quest">
				&emsp;&nbsp;I am a Data Science Major at
				<a href="https://www.khoury.northeastern.edu/" class="white">Northeastern University</a>
				, who is interested in data driven and analytical solutions to everyday problems. Successful programming is all about
				organization and leadership. That is why I have prioritized pursuing leadership roles within the Northeastern
				community. For the last two years, I have supported the course Fundamentals of Computer Science 1 at Northeastern
				University in a variety of roles. Currently, I work as a teacher's assistant where I organize and instruct a weekly
				lab lecture for 45 students, mentor other computer science tutors, grade exams, and host weekly office hours. I take pride in the growth of my students and
				mentoring other computer science tutors. I get great satisfaction in helping students grow their ability to learn and
				understanding of computer science principles.<br>
				&emsp;&nbsp;I am a passionate person dedicated to pursuing my interests with a witty sense of humor, whether that is
				green energy solutions, sports analytics, or music. I strongly believe that a small group of motivated individuals can change
				the world one day at a time and I cannot wait to get started!<br>
				&emsp;&nbsp;Here are a few programming languages I've been working with recently:

				"Out of the many TAs that I had the chance to meet throughout the semester, I found Sid to be one of the most
				effective. Whether it was helping me spot errors in my code or simply helping me grasp the general concepts, he was
				always willing to take as much time as I needed to understand. When a large group of students had a common problem,
				he even invited us to the board and used diagrams or drawings to help everyone at once, which I found to be very
				efficient considering the consistently high ratio of students to TAs in office hours. However, I personally felt that
				what helped me the most was Sidâ€™s use of his past experiences to help me gain confidence and pride in my work. As a
				student with no prior computer science experience, I felt hopelessly behind, but his ability to relate to my position
				made it clear that success was anything but impossible."

				<p class="about alignLeft quest">
					&emsp;&nbsp;When my team initially discussed this project, we agreed to focus on a green energy source.
					After some initial research, we noticed that wind energy is often either overlooked or criticized as inefficient because
					turbines cannot convert wind into electricity at a 100% efficiency. Yet the amount of actual electricity a wind
					turbine can produce is never mentioned. We wanted to focus on the energy produced from wind turbines to dispell
					myths surrounding this green energy source. This project hoped to provide evidence supporting building more
					wind turbines to lessen our dependence on harmful energy sources wreaking havoc on our atmosphere.<br>

					&emsp;&nbsp;The goal of this project was to gather data on weather and determine how much power would be generated
					by a wind turbine from a variety of features. For our hypothesis test we specifically looked at whether the time of
					day (early morning, mid-morning, afternoon, or night) effected the amount of power generated and the results of our
					statistical tests provided evidence supporting a relationship between the two. We then used predictive supervised
					regression models to predict the amount of power generated based on our features. When evaluating our models, we
					found that linear regression, Ridge, and Lasso algorithms had the best performance and were the most effective
					predictive models.<br>
