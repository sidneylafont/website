				&emsp;&nbsp;I am a Data Science Major at
				<a href="https://www.khoury.northeastern.edu/" class="white">Northeastern University</a>
				, who is interested in data driven and analytical solutions to everyday problems. Successful programming is all about
				organization and leadership. That is why I have prioritized pursuing leadership roles within the Northeastern
				community. For the last two years, I have supported the course Fundamentals of Computer Science 1 at Northeastern
				University in a variety of roles. Currently, I work as a teacher's assistant where I organize and instruct a weekly
				lab lecture for 45 students, mentor other computer science tutors, grade exams, and host weekly office hours. I take pride in the growth of my students and
				mentoring other computer science tutors. I get great satisfaction in helping students grow their ability to learn and
				understanding of computer science principles.<br>
				&emsp;&nbsp;I am a passionate person dedicated to pursuing my interests with a witty sense of humor, whether that is
				green energy solutions, sports analytics, or bioinformatics. I strongly believe that a small group of motivated individuals can change
				the world one day at a time and I cannot wait to get started!<br>

				"Out of the many TAs that I had the chance to meet throughout the semester, I found Sid to be one of the most
				effective. Whether it was helping me spot errors in my code or simply helping me grasp the general concepts, he was
				always willing to take as much time as I needed to understand. When a large group of students had a common problem,
				he even invited us to the board and used diagrams or drawings to help everyone at once, which I found to be very
				efficient considering the consistently high ratio of students to TAs in office hours. However, I personally felt that
				what helped me the most was his use of his past experiences to help me gain confidence and pride in my work. As a
				student with no prior computer science experience, I felt hopelessly behind, but his ability to relate to my position
				made it clear that success was anything but impossible."

			<h1 class="subname center quest">Analyzing Energy Generated from Wind as a Result of Time of Day and Environmental Factors</h2>
				<p class="about alignLeft quest">
					&emsp;&nbsp;When my team initially discussed this project, we agreed to focus on a green energy source.
					After some initial research, we noticed that wind energy is often either overlooked or criticized as inefficient because
					turbines cannot convert wind into electricity at a 100% efficiency. Yet the amount of actual electricity a wind
					turbine can produce is never mentioned. We wanted to focus on the energy produced from wind turbines to dispell
					myths surrounding this green energy source. This project hoped to provide evidence supporting building more
					wind turbines to lessen our dependence on harmful energy sources wreaking havoc on our atmosphere.<br>

					&emsp;&nbsp;The goal of this project was to gather data on weather and determine how much power would be generated
					by a wind turbine from a variety of features. For our hypothesis test we specifically looked at whether the time of
					day (early morning, mid-morning, afternoon, or night) effected the amount of power generated and the results of our
					statistical tests provided evidence supporting a relationship between the two. We then used predictive supervised
					regression models to predict the amount of power generated based on our features. When evaluating our models, we
					found that linear regression, Ridge, and Lasso algorithms had the best performance and were the most effective
					predictive models.<br>

			<h1 class="subname center quest"> Biolink</h2>
				<p class="about alignLeft quest">
					&emsp;&nbsp;Biolink is a database of networked biological knowledge, mostly derived from PubChem, reformatted
					into Neo4j to leverage the abilities of a graph database management system. The goal of Biolink is to create a
					multi-model database to support queries on biological knowledge in the domains of genes, proteins, diseases,
					clinical trials, pathways, functional annotations (GO), bioassays, and compounds (Pubchem). Biolink can also
					serve as a nomenclature translation service.<br>

					&emsp;&nbsp;I worked on a team tasked with expanding Biolink by adding new node types  and associations from
					the data found in PubChem. Specifically, we added the new node types Bioassays and Compounds and associations from
					Bioassays to Genes (a node type that already existed in Neo4j) and Compounds to Bioassays. As a final result, now
					that we have added compounds and their associated bioassays, we can understand the effects of compounds on various
					diseases - since compounds are tested by specific bioassays, which interact with genes, which are associated with
					diseases.<br>

			<h1 class="subname center quest"> Boston Local Food Data Dashboard</h2>
				<p class="about alignLeft quest">
					&emsp;&nbsp;The dashboard of visualizations were design with and for the Sustainable Business Network of
					Massachusetts a nonprofit organization in the Boston area that promotes local farms with sustainable practices.
					The Project was coded using a combination of JavaScript, D3 (a JavaScript library for creating interactive data
					visualizations in	web browsers), HTML, and CSS.<br>

					&emsp;&nbsp;My team's project is a dashboard that aims to promote awareness among buyers and wholesale producers
					(vendors) about the availability of sustainable and local food. Through our dashboard, we aim to foster these
					relationships by filling in the information gap that exists between buyers looking to purchase local food, and
					wholesale producers looking for more distribution channels. The needs of the organization include connecting buyers
					to vendors as larger institutions (buyers) are not well informed about the availability of local food. We are
					addressing this need by creating a dashboard that identifies the location of various vendors that wholesale
					local food, along with how much they produce and are willing to increase in production (and whether or not they
					have a trade relationship) so that buyers can connect to them.<br>
