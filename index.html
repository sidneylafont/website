				<p class="centerText">	
					&emsp;&nbsp;After two years at <a href="https://www.commonspirit.org/" class="white">CommonSpirit Health</a>, 
					I was promoted to Senior Data Architect. In this role, I became a key member of the team leading the 
					technical implementation of Workday’s ERP application. As part of this project, I have been redesigning 
					CommonSpirit Health’s supply chain data schema and consolidating ten different healthcare supply chain 
					schemas and databases into that new schema, working closely with subject matter experts. I also began 
					leading my team’s code reviews and CI/CD development utilizing Azure DevOps. This role has allowed me to 
					continue to develop my leadership and communication skills and broaden my supply chain expertise across 
					multiple ERP applications. <br>
					&emsp;&nbsp;Additionally, I kept the responsibilities of my previous role at CSH, as described below, 
					including building and maintaining the data warehouse, designing and coding ETL data pipelines, and 
					analyzing complex healthcare datasets. 
				</p>

			<p class="leftLabel"> Data Scientist, June 2023 - May 2025... </p>
				<p class="centerText">
				&emsp;&nbsp;In this role, I was primarily focused on building and maintaining CommonSpirit Health’s Data 
				warehouse, designing and coding ETL data pipelines, analyzing complex healthcare datasets, building bots 
				to automate manual Lawson ERP tasks, and integrating new technology whenever possible. <br>
				&emsp;&nbsp;I added to and maintained CSH’s data warehouse utilizing big data tools such as DBT, Prefect, 
				Redshift, GCP, and Azure DevOps, ensuring data quality, integrity, and consistency. I designed, coded, and 
				maintained Python ETL data pipelines that connect disparate healthcare data sources, such as EHR systems, 
				ERP systems, and external data feeds, including Premier, Clarium, GHX, etc. I analyzed expansive and complex 
				healthcare datasets to identify patterns, trends, and anomalies, using statistical techniques to draw 
				meaningful conclusions from data. I built bots to automate highly manual Lawson ERP tasks. I did all this 
				while participating in code reviews and CI/CD development utilizing Azure DevOps for Git and AGILE project 
				management. <br>
				&emsp;&nbsp;My biggest impact in this role was integrating new technologies. I was part of the team that 
				transitioned CSH’s cloud data warehouse from AWS Redshift to Google Cloud Platform (GCP), updating legacy 
				code for data models, tables, reports, ETL pipelines, etc., to seamlessly function with the new cloud data 
				warehouse service. I also pioneered email automation in the supply chain department. Utilizing a relay server 
				to automate sending emails for multiple projects. Estimated time saved: 100 hours per week for some projects.

			&emsp;&nbsp; This paper covers the Alternative Route-Based Attack which targets cities made up of Connected and Autonomous Vehicles
			through intelligent graph algorithms. I first authored this paper during my co-op at the <a href="https://nds2.ccs.neu.edu/" class="white">Northeastern University Network and Distributed Systems Security Lab (NDS2)</a>

			<p class="leftLabel"> The Abstract... <p>

			<p class="centerText">
			With the growing reliance on driving direction applications that dynamically account for live traffic updates, drivers
			are much more likely to act optimally, by taking the shortest path to their destination, and therefore more predictably.
			As city networks transition into being made up of connected and autonomous vehicles, autonomous driving pilots are even
			more likely to act optimally and predictably. The predictability that comes from acting optimally allows motivated
			attackers to manipulate driver(s) to travel chosen slower alternative routes by causing disruptions on road segments
			that are part of faster routes. A motivated attacker could use this method to cause a number of different harms such
			as forcing specific vehicles to take unnecessarily long routes, forcing all vehicles traveling between popular
			locations to follow a chosen route, or making vehicles travel specific road segments that the attacker chose,
			such as toll roads. In this work, we show the feasibility and practicality of conducting such attacks on several
			real traffic networks of major North American cities. We analyze several attack objectives under different attacker
			constraints and we demonstrated that an attacker could find an attack strategy in a matter of seconds. <br>

					&emsp;&nbsp;Global warming is a problem that is worsening daily. It is going to have more and more drastic
					effects on humankind unless it is addressed. Our project revolves around demonstrating the effect global warming
					 is having on the extent of the Arctic and Antarctic sea ice cover, through important climate features.
					The extent of the Arctic and Antarctic sea ice cover is determined by the area of the ocean made up of at least 15% sea ice.
					<br>
					&emsp;&nbsp;In general, the goal of our project is to illustrate the severity of our current and future climate
					crisis. We used several important climate features including the average monthly global temperature
					from Berkeley Earth, CO2 levels from the Scripps Institute of Oceanography, and the number of natural disasters
					that occurred on a specific date from the Center for Research on the Epidemiology of Disasters to
					predict the extent of the Arctic and Antarctic sea ice cover.

				<p class="about alignLeft quest">
					&emsp;&nbsp;The goal of this project was to gather data on weather and determine how much power would be generated
					by building and operating a new wind turbine in a specific area from a variety of climate features. For our hypothesis test, we specifically looked at whether the time of
					day (early morning, mid-morning, afternoon, or night) affected the amount of power generated. The results of our
					statistical tests provided evidence supporting a relationship between the two. We then used predictive supervised
					regression models to predict the amount of power generated based on our features. When evaluating our models, we
					found that linear regression, Ridge, and Lasso algorithms had the best performance and were the most effective
					predictive models.<br>

					&emsp;&nbsp;When my team initially discussed this project, we agreed to focus on a green energy source.
					After some initial research, we noticed that wind energy is often either overlooked or criticized as inefficient because
					turbines cannot convert wind into electricity at 100% efficiency. Yet the amount of actual electricity a wind
					turbine can produce is seldom mentioned. We wanted to focus on the energy produced by wind turbines to dispel
					myths surrounding this green energy source. This project aspired to provide evidence supporting building more
					wind turbines to lessen our dependence on the harmful energy sources wreaking havoc on our atmosphere.<br>
