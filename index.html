				&emsp;&nbsp;I am a Data Science Major at
				<a href="https://www.khoury.northeastern.edu/" class="white">Northeastern University</a>
				, who is interested in data driven and analytical solutions to everyday problems. Successful programming is all about
				organization and leadership. That is why I have prioritized pursuing leadership roles within the Northeastern
				community. For the last two years, I have supported the course Fundamentals of Computer Science 1 at Northeastern
				University in a variety of roles. Currently, I work as a teacher's assistant where I organize and instruct a weekly
				lab lecture for up to 101 students (depending on the semester), mentor other computer science tutors, grade exams,
				and host weekly office hours. I take pride in the growth of my students and mentoring other computer science tutors.
				I get great satisfaction in helping students grow their ability to learn and understanding of computer science
				principles.<br>
				&emsp;&nbsp;I am a passionate person dedicated to pursuing my interests with a witty sense of humor, whether that is
				green energy solutions, sports analytics, or bioinformatics. I strongly believe that a small group of motivated individuals can change
				the world one day at a time and I cannot wait to get started!<br>

			<blockquote class="centerQuote">
				"Out of the many TAs that I had the chance to meet throughout the semester, I found Sid to be one of the most
				effective. Whether it was helping me spot errors in my code or simply helping me grasp the general concepts, he was
				always willing to take as much time as I needed to understand. When a large group of students had a common problem,
				he even invited us to the board and used diagrams or drawings to help everyone at once, which I found to be very
				efficient considering the consistently high ratio of students to TAs in office hours. However, I personally felt that
				what helped me the most was his use of his past experiences to help me gain confidence and pride in my work. As a
				student with no prior computer science experience, I felt hopelessly behind, but his ability to relate to my position
				made it clear that success was anything but impossible."

			<h1 class="subname center quest">Analyzing Energy Generated from Wind as a Result of Time of Day and Environmental Factors</h2>
				<p class="about alignLeft quest">
					&emsp;&nbsp;The goal of this project was to gather data on weather and determine how much power would be generated
					by a wind turbine in the future from a variety of features. For our hypothesis test we specifically looked at whether the time of
					day (early morning, mid-morning, afternoon, or night) effected the amount of power generated and the results of our
					statistical tests provided evidence supporting a relationship between the two. We then used predictive supervised
					regression models to predict the amount of power generated based on our features. When evaluating our models, we
					found that linear regression, Ridge, and Lasso algorithms had the best performance and were the most effective
					predictive models.<br>

					&emsp;&nbsp;When my team initially discussed this project, we agreed to focus on a green energy source.
					After some initial research, we noticed that wind energy is often either overlooked or criticized as inefficient because
					turbines cannot convert wind into electricity at a 100% efficiency. Yet the amount of actual electricity a wind
					turbine can produce is never mentioned. We wanted to focus on the energy produced from wind turbines to dispell
					myths surrounding this green energy source. This project hoped to provide evidence supporting building more
					wind turbines to lessen our dependence on harmful energy sources wreaking havoc on our atmosphere.<br>

				<p class="about alignLeft quest">
					&emsp;&nbsp;Biolink is a database of networked biological knowledge reformatted
					into Neo4j to leverage the abilities of a graph database management system. The goal of Biolink is to create a
					multi-model database to support queries on biological knowledge in the domains of genes, proteins, diseases,
					clinical trials, pathways, functional annotations (GO), bioassays, and compounds (Pubchem). Biolink can also
					serve as a nomenclature translation service.<br>

					&emsp;&nbsp;I worked on a team tasked with expanding Biolink by adding new node types  and associations from
					the data found on PubChem. Specifically, we added two new node types bioassays and compounds and associations from
					bioassays to genes (a node type that already existed in Neo4j) and compounds to bioassays. As a final result, now
					that we have added compounds and their associated bioassays, we can understand the effects of compounds on various
					diseases because compounds are tested by specific bioassays, which interact with genes, which are associated with
					diseases.<br>

				<p class="about alignLeft quest">
					&emsp;&nbsp;The dashboard of visualizations was designed for the Boston Local Food Festival with the Sustainable
					Business Network of Massachusetts a nonprofit organization in the Boston area that promotes local farms with
					sustainable practices and organizes the Boston Local Food Festival. The Project was coded using a
					combination of JavaScript, D3 (a JavaScript library for creating interactive data visualizations in	web browsers), HTML, and CSS.<br>

					&emsp;&nbsp;My team's dashboard aims to promote awareness among buyers and wholesale producers
					about the availability of sustainable and local food. Through our dashboard, we aim to foster these
					relationships by filling in the information gap that exists between buyers looking to purchase local food, and
					wholesale producers looking for more distribution channels. In general, our dashboard promotes connecting buyers
					to vendors as larger scale buyers are not well informed about the availability of local food. We
					addressed this by creating a dashboard that identifies the location of various vendors that wholesale
					local food, along with how much they produce, whether or not they have a trade relationship with a large
					buyer, and if they are willing to increase production so that buyers can connect to them.<br>

				<p class="about alignLeft quest">
					&emsp;&nbsp; Steganography, the practice of concealing a file, message, image, or video within another file such as
					a file, message, image, or video, has been used for centuries. The first documented steganographic technique was
					created in 440 B.C. when the Greek ruler Histaeus shaved the heads of his slaves and tattooed a message on them, and then
					waiting for hair growth to hide the message. Invisible ink was another popular steganographic technique, which was
					even used by George Washington and the Culper spy ring during the Civil War. I created a script that uses the
					practice of steganography to hide a message, up to 1000000 characters long, into any image. Potentially allowing
					users to pass hidden messages.<br>

			<h1 class="subname center quest"> Gaussian Blur</h2>
				<p class="about alignLeft quest">
					&emsp;&nbsp; A Gaussian blur, also known as Gaussian smoothing, is a specific technique to blur images that determines
					the new color of each pixel based on the average color of nearby pixels weighted towards the closest pixels, using a
					Gaussian function. Blur filters, such as the Gaussian blur, have become incredibly common especially in photography
					where blur filters are standard in most cameras and are the base of many other types of filters. Gaussian blurs
					have become particularly integral to computer vision and graphic software where they are used to
					reduce image noise and reduce detail so that the images and videos are focused on the integral features.<br>

					&emsp;&nbsp; A Slow Loris a Denial of Service attack invented by Robert "RSnake" Hansen, which attacks a
