			<p class="centerText">

			&emsp;&nbsp; This paper covers the Alternative Route-Based Attack which targets cities made up of Connected and Autonomous Vehicles
			through intelligent graph algorithms. I first authored this paper during my co-op at the <a href="https://nds2.ccs.neu.edu/" class="white">Northeastern University Network and Distributed Systems Security Lab (NDS2)</a>
			on a grant funded by <a href="https://amrd.toyota.com/division/itl/" class="white"> Toyota InfoTech Labs</a> and

			<p class="leftLabel"> The Abstract... <p>

			<p class="centerText">
			With the growing reliance on driving direction applications that dynamically account for live traffic updates, drivers
			are much more likely to act optimally, by taking the shortest path to their destination, and therefore more predictably.
			As city networks transition into being made up of connected and autonomous vehicles, autonomous driving pilots are even
			more likely to act optimally and predictably. The predictability that comes from acting optimally allows motivated
			attackers to manipulate driver(s) to travel chosen slower alternative routes by causing disruptions on road segments
			that are part of faster routes. A motivated attacker could use this method to cause a number of different harms such
			as forcing specific vehicles to take unnecessarily long routes, forcing all vehicles traveling between popular
			locations to follow a chosen route, or making vehicles travel specific road segments that the attacker chose,
			such as toll roads. In this work, we show the feasibility and practicality of conducting such attacks on several
			real traffic networks of major North American cities. We analyze several attack objectives under different attacker
			constraints and we demonstrated that an attacker could find an attack strategy in a matter of seconds. <br>

				"Out of the many TAs (Teaching Assistants) that I had the chance to meet throughout the semester, I found Sid to be one of the most

				always willing to take as much time as I needed to understand. When a large group of students had a common problem,
				he even invited us to the board and used diagrams or drawings to help everyone at once, which I found to be very
				efficient considering the consistently high ratio of students to TAs in office hours. However, I personally felt that
				what helped me the most was his use of his past experiences to help me gain confidence and pride in my work. As a

					The extent of the Arctic and Antarctic sea ice cover is determined by the area of the ocean made up of at least 15% sea ice.
					<br>
					&emsp;&nbsp;In general, the goal of our project is to illustrate the severity of our current and future climate
					crisis. We used several important climate features including the average monthly global temperature
					from Berkeley Earth, CO2 levels from the Scripps Institute of Oceanography, and the number of natural disasters
					that occurred on a specific date from the Center for Research on the Epidemiology of Disasters to
					predict the extent of the Arctic and Antarctic sea ice cover.

				<p class="about alignLeft quest">
					&emsp;&nbsp;The goal of this project was to gather data on weather and determine how much power would be generated
					by building and operating a new wind turbine in a specific area from a variety of climate features. For our hypothesis test, we specifically looked at whether the time of
					day (early morning, mid-morning, afternoon, or night) affected the amount of power generated. The results of our
					statistical tests provided evidence supporting a relationship between the two. We then used predictive supervised
					regression models to predict the amount of power generated based on our features. When evaluating our models, we
					found that linear regression, Ridge, and Lasso algorithms had the best performance and were the most effective
					predictive models.<br>

					&emsp;&nbsp;When my team initially discussed this project, we agreed to focus on a green energy source.
					After some initial research, we noticed that wind energy is often either overlooked or criticized as inefficient because
					turbines cannot convert wind into electricity at 100% efficiency. Yet the amount of actual electricity a wind
					turbine can produce is seldom mentioned. We wanted to focus on the energy produced by wind turbines to dispel
					myths surrounding this green energy source. This project aspired to provide evidence supporting building more
					wind turbines to lessen our dependence on the harmful energy sources wreaking havoc on our atmosphere.<br>

					serve as a nomenclature translation service.<br>

					&emsp;&nbsp;My team was tasked with expanding Biolink by adding new node types and associations from
					the data found on PubChem to Biolink's Neo4j and MongoDB databases. Specifically, we added two new node types (bioassays and compounds) and two new associations
					(bioassays to genes and compounds to bioassays). As a final result, after adding compounds and their associated bioassays,
					Biolink users can understand the effects of compounds on various diseases. This is due to compounds being tested by
					bioassays that interact with genes associated with specific diseases.<br>
